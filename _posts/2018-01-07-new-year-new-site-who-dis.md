This year I have decided to embark on the adventure of blogging about my experiences and things I learn as I build
software for the web.  Doing so requires a platform, hence the design and deployment of this brand new site.

Before you ask, yes this site design is __heavily__ inspired by [Yehuda Katz's Site](http://yehudakatz.com/), I quit
pretending I was a [designer](http://www.dribbble.com/aaronmallen) a long time ago.

That being said, I am new to this whole blogging thing.  It would be remiss of me to go without warning my audience
that grammar and spelling are not my strongest traits. Definitely expect a grammatical error or two-hundred,
however, if we can get past that aspect of blogging I am excited to share the developer experience with the internet.

### Introductions

I am a self-taught software engineer from New Braunfels, TX. Currently, I sun-lighting at a company called
[Moxie Software](http://www.gomoxie.com) in Austin, TX.  I have been building things on the web for going on 14 years
with a primary focus on projects with [Angular 1.x](https://angularjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and my personal
favorite [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).  I've had past experience working on C#, Visual Basic, and SQL
projects as well.  Recently I've begun playing with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) for fun, and NLP projects for
work specifically focused on Topic Modeling and Recommender Systems.  I'm sure we'll discuss that in more detail in
later posts.

### A Purpose and Goals

Documentation has always been a pain point for software developers. I cannot even tell you how many times I've found the
answer to some obscure Angular issue via some other developers blog.  I've come to realize when technical documentation
isn't up to snuff or sometimes even when it is, we tend to rely on the experience of other developers to help us out
with our day to day issues.  So that's the purpose here, in a nutshell, simply to be another faucet of experience that
you may stumble across in your google search that hopefully helped you out.

I'd like to write a post on here once a week.  Bear in mind this is neither a promise nor a limitation.  This month, in
particular, I believe I will have plenty to write about.  Tomorrow I onboard a new hire at Moxie, and the week after that
I'm headed to Austin Data Day which is an annually held NLP and AI convention.

So with that, I'll sign off and deploy this site.  I have a few kinks to iron out on the site still which I will be
updating as I find the time to do so.  I plan to implement some form of feedback system eventually, but for now feel
free to reach out to me via [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/aaronmallen).
