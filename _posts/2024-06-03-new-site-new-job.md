My adventures at [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com) came to a close on March 12 of this year. During my tenure as a
Senior Software Development Engineer at Zillow Group, I played a key role in migrating StreetEasy to a Commands and Queries
pattern within the Rails monolith, extracting tightly coupled controller logic into reusable service objects.<!--more-->
In addition I participated in the consolidation of NakedApartments into StreetEasy, ensuring a smooth transition and
alignment of branding strategies.

While leading two pods as a Technical Lead, I was instrumental in migrating StreetEasy from a Rails monolith to Java
Micronaut services. Additionally, I contributed to the creation of a subscription-based system called the Industry Experts
Program for agents interested in listing on StreetEasy.

Working at StreetEasy provided me with the opportunity to hone my skills in various technologies and frameworks. I was able
to leverage my expertise in Ruby, JavaScript, and Java to drive the faster delivery of high-quality technology solutions and
improved user experiences. My experience in full-stack development, coupled with my passion for harnessing machine learning
technologies, allowed me to make substantial contributions to the team.

Leaving StreetEasy was a bittersweet moment for me. While I was sad to say goodbye to my colleagues and the projects I was
passionate about, I am excited about the new opportunities that lie ahead. I look forward to applying the skills and
knowledge I've gained at StreetEasy to new challenges and continuing to grow both personally and professionally.

With that being said, I've accepted a new role as a Senior Software Engineer at [Root Insurance](https://joinroot.com)! I
am thrilled to join an innovative company that is redefining the insurance industry with technology and data-driven
insights.

At Root Insurance, I will be working remotely from Ohio, contributing to the development of cutting-edge solutions that
leverage telematics and machine learning to offer personalized and fair insurance rates. This role provides an exciting
opportunity to apply my extensive experience in software engineering, particularly in areas such as system architecture,
and full-stack development.

I am particularly excited about the chance to work on scalable systems and to be part of a team that is committed to
pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve in the insurance sector. Joining Root Insurance allows me to bring my
skills in Ruby and JavaScript to a new and challenging environment, where I can continue to grow and make meaningful
contributions.

I look forward to collaborating with my new colleagues at Root Insurance and being part of a mission-driven company that is
making a tangible difference in people's lives by simplifying the insurance process and providing more equitable solutions.
This new chapter in my career promises to be both challenging and rewarding, and I am eager to get started.

Additionally, as part of the job hunting process, I decided to redesign my personal site. The new site, built with
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), showcases my portfolio, highlights my
professional journey, and serves as a platform to share my thoughts on software development and technology.

Using Jekyll allowed me to create a static site that is fast, secure, and easy to maintain. I took advantage of Tailwind
CSS to design a clean and responsive user interface, ensuring that the site looks great on any device. The combination of
these technologies enabled me to focus on content creation while providing a modern and visually appealing experience for
visitors.

The redesign process was a valuable opportunity to apply my front-end development skills and to experiment with new design
patterns. It also allowed me to reflect on my career achievements and present them in a cohesive and engaging manner. You
can check out the new site at [aaronmallen.me](https://www.aaronmallen.me) to see my latest projects, read my blog posts,
and learn more about my professional background.

I plan to write a detailed guide soon, outlining the step-by-step process of the redesign to share knowledge on using
Jekyll with Tailwind CSS for personal site development. In the meantime, you can check out the source code for my
personal site on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaronmallen/aaronmallen.github.io).
