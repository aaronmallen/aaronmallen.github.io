        <div class='prose'>
          <p>
            As a senior software engineer at <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Root Insurance</span>, I am
            dedicated to developing and maintaining robust web applications and services that enable millions of
            individuals to obtain affordable car insurance. My proficiency is centered around the
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Ruby on Rails</span> and
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Node.js</span> frameworks, bolstered by over
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>12 years</span> of extensive experience in the web development
            industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            My previous experience includes a significant tenure at
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Zillow Group</span>, where I played a crucial role in migrating
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>StreetEasy</span> to a Commands and Queries pattern within a
            Rails monolith. This involved extracting tightly coupled controller logic into reusable service objects,
            which significantly improved the maintainability and scalability of the codebase. I also spearheaded the
            consolidation of NakedApartments into StreetEasy, ensuring a seamless transition and alignment of branding
            strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Zillow, I developed a strategy for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication to streamline access across
            StreetEasy's Java services, including both monolithic and federated GraphQL implementations. Additionally, I
            led two technical pods, guiding the migration of StreetEasy from a Rails monolith to Java Micronaut
            services. I also contributed to the creation of the subscription-based Industry Experts Program for agents
            interested in listing on StreetEasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Moxie</span>, as a Junior Software Engineer, I played a major
            role in developing a Ruby on Rails Knowledge Base application. I spearheaded the company's exploration into
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Natural Language Processing</span> and machine learning
            technologies and optimized UI components across products through the development of an
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Angular 1.x</span> application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an active maintainer of the
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>ActiveInteractor</span> Ruby Gem, an implementation of the
            Command pattern in Ruby, which I have been developing since 2019. My dedication to continuous professional
            development is underscored by certifications in
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>agile development</span> practices and
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>machine learning</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I excel in collaborative environments, regularly participating in hackathons and contributing to innovative
            projects alongside fellow developers. My efforts have been recognized through numerous accolades, including
            triumphs at the
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>Moxie Ignite</span> hackathon in 2015 and 2017, and the
            <span class='text-daisy-bush font-semibold'>City and Sand</span> hackathon in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            My technical expertise is complemented by strong skills in various programming languages and frameworks,
            including Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, tSQL, pSQL, MySQL, React, Vue.js, Apollo, Sinatra,
            and Electron. I am adept at driving faster delivery of high-quality technology solutions and improving user
            experiences through my full-stack development capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an analytical and agile software engineer, I am experienced at managing the software development
            lifecycle, including software testing, debugging, and designing scalable code. Through substantial
            experience collaborating with others, I have cultivated the ability to lead and train cross-functional,
            technical teams, enabling us to achieve collective goals and shared visions. I am an active problem-solver,
            critical thinker, and communicator, consistently uncovering root causes of complex issues via innovative
            solutions.
