      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        As a senior software engineer at Root Insurance, I am dedicated to developing and maintaining robust web
        applications and services that enable millions of individuals to obtain affordable car insurance. My proficiency
        is centered around the Ruby on Rails and Node.js frameworks, bolstered by over 12 years of extensive experience
        in the web development industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        My previous experience includes a significant tenure at Zillow Group, where I played a crucial role in migrating
        StreetEasy to a Commands and Queries pattern within a Rails monolith. This involved extracting tightly coupled
        controller logic into reusable service objects, which significantly improved the maintainability and scalability
        of the codebase. I also spearheaded the consolidation of NakedApartments into StreetEasy, ensuring a seamless
        transition and alignment of branding strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Zillow, I developed a strategy for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication to streamline access across
        StreetEasy's Java services, including both monolithic and federated GraphQL implementations. Additionally, I led
        two technical pods, guiding the migration of StreetEasy from a Rails monolith to Java Micronaut services. I also
        contributed to the creation of the subscription-based Industry Experts Program for agents interested in listing
        on StreetEasy.
      </p>
      <p>
        At Moxie, as a Junior Software Engineer, I played a major role in developing a Ruby on Rails Knowledge Base
        application. I spearheaded the company's exploration into Natural Language Processing and machine learning
        technologies and optimized UI components across products through the development of an Angular 1.x application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an active maintainer of the ActiveInteractor Ruby Gem, an implementation
        of the Command pattern in Ruby, which I have been developing since 2019. My dedication to continuous
        professional development is underscored by certifications in agile development practices and machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I excel in collaborative environments, regularly participating in hackathons and contributing to innovative
        projects alongside fellow developers. My efforts have been recognized through numerous accolades, including
        triumphs at the Moxie Ignite hackathon in 2015 and 2017, and the City and Sand hackathon in 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical expertise is complemented by strong skills in various programming languages and frameworks,
        including Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, tSQL, pSQL, MySQL, React, Vue.js, Apollo, Sinatra, and
        Electron. I am adept at driving faster delivery of high-quality technology solutions and improving user
        experiences through my full-stack development capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an analytical and agile software engineer, I am experienced at managing the software development lifecycle,
        including software testing, debugging, and designing scalable code. Through substantial experience collaborating
        with others, I have cultivated the ability to lead and train cross-functional, technical teams, enabling us to
        achieve collective goals and shared visions. I am an active problem-solver, critical thinker, and communicator,
        consistently uncovering root causes of complex issues via innovative solutions.
