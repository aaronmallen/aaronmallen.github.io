    <p>
      As a senior software engineer at Root Insurance, I am dedicated to developing and maintaining robust web
      applications and services that enable millions to obtain affordable car insurance. My proficiency in Ruby on Rails
      and Node.js frameworks is bolstered by over 12 years of extensive experience in the web development industry.

      At Zillow Group, I played a crucial role in migrating StreetEasy to a Commands and Queries pattern within a Rails
      monolith. This involved extracting tightly coupled controller logic into reusable service objects, significantly
      improving the maintainability and scalability of the codebase. I also spearheaded the consolidation of
      NakedApartments into StreetEasy, ensuring a seamless transition and alignment of branding strategies.

      Additionally, at Zillow, I developed a strategy for Single Sign-On (SSO) authentication to streamline access
      across StreetEasy's Java services, including both monolithic and federated GraphQL implementations. I led two
      technical pods, guiding the migration of StreetEasy from a Rails monolith to Java Micronaut services. I also
      contributed to the creation of the subscription-based Industry Experts Program for agents interested in listing on
      StreetEasy.

      As a Junior Software Engineer at Moxie, I played a major role in developing a Ruby on Rails Knowledge Base
      application. I spearheaded the company's exploration into Natural Language Processing and machine learning
      technologies and optimized UI components across products through the development of an Angular 1.x application.
    </p>

    <p>
      Beyond my professional pursuits, I am an active maintainer of the ActiveInteractor Ruby Gem, an implementation of
      the Command pattern in Ruby, which I have been developing since 2019. My dedication to continuous professional
      development is underscored by certifications in agile development practices and machine learning.
    </p>

    <p>
      I excel in collaborative environments, regularly participating in hackathons and contributing to innovative
      projects alongside fellow developers. My efforts have been recognized through numerous accolades, including
      triumphs at the Moxie Ignite hackathon in 2015 and 2017, and the City and Sand hackathon in 2018.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical expertise encompasses various programming languages and frameworks, including Ruby, JavaScript, C#,
      Python, HTML, CSS, SASS, tSQL, pSQL, MySQL, React, Vue.js, Apollo, Sinatra, and Electron. I am adept at driving
      faster delivery of high-quality technology solutions and improving user experiences through my full-stack
      development capabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      As an analytical and agile software engineer, I am experienced in managing the software development lifecycle,
      including software testing, debugging, and designing scalable code. Through substantial experience collaborating
      with others, I have cultivated the ability to lead and train cross-functional technical teams, enabling us to
      achieve collective goals and shared visions. I am an active problem-solver, critical thinker, and communicator,
      consistently uncovering the root causes of complex issues via innovative solutions.
